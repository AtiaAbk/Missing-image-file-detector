# Missing-image-file-detector
Identify missing image numbers from large image folders using Python.

📁 Missing Image File Identifier (Python) is a Python tool to 🔍 detect missing images in folders with numeric filenames (e.g., 123.jpg → 123). It scans a folder, checks against a continuous sequence (1–8000), ⚠️ identifies missing files, and optionally 💾 saves them to a .txt file. Perfect for 🧠 dataset validation, 📊 data preprocessing, and 🏭 large-scale image audits. Built with Python 3.x and 🛠 standard libraries only.
